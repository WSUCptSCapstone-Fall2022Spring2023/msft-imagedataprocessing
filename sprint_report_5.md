# Sprint 5 Report (2/2/23 - 3/2/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * REST API Is ready
 * Quadrilateral plot processing is ready

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint our team worked efficiently to create the REST API for our system. This rest API was the majority of our work this sprint and allows for future contributors to the project to easily interface our current system. We did not run into any issues while working on the API. While this was being completed Zach was able to update some sensor code inorder for it have optimized scheduling. Quadrilateral processing of plots is now ready for our system which will allow for more dynamic selection of plots on our sensors. Our team benefited greatly this sprint by laying out all issues at the start of the sprint and starting work early instead of waiting.

## Unfinished Work
We were not able to finish our documentation or close the NDVI rest-api endpoint. These are trivial issues and will be addressed at the start of the next sprint quickly.
