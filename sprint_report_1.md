# Sprint 1 Report (8/26/21 - 9/24/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 Currently, there is nothing new user facing. We have created a rough document containing the details of this project users can view.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Throughout this sprint our team has worked to come to an agreement with our client on the specifications for our project. Starting out there was a lot of uncertainty with what was going to be asked of us for our project. The client told us they had two main focus points for us. Efficiency of system and network connectivity improvement. 
The client has confirmed with us that they would appreciate for us to convert their current python script setup to something more efficient such as a application written in C/C++ or Rust. We were lost when it came to how we would improve the signal however this was laid out for us very well when we met with another one of our clients who is going to be the farmer testing our product.
We will be evaluating the difference between simcards to a private cell tower and LoRa to address the clients connectivity issues. Outside of these two issues though there was not a lot of applicable work for our teams skillset so we went to the client and offered to create a well-layed out front-end for them. 
They agreed to this so we have layed out that we will be completing the following for them over the coming sprints. Improved camera-code base, Tested network options with a report on their options and a recommendation from our team. Persistent database with friendly user-front end allowing our client to easily access the data from their AGIcameras.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/msft-imagedataprocessing/issues/23 We were not able to complete this issue because we simply ran out of time with complications due to the health of our team members
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/msft-imagedataprocessing/issues/21 We have not recieved information from our client on what they want the front-end to look like.

## Code Files for Review
There were no code files to review from this sprint.
 
## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Team communication, we were able to communicate effectively and be there for each other when there were complications with a team-members schedule or personal life.
  * Work assigned, our team did a good job having everyone complete the work assigned to them in a timely manner. We did not have to worry ever about if a member would complete their tasks.
  * General Project understanding, To start this project our team was very confused on how we would provide value to the client but after using this sprint to dig into the project and understand what the client wants and more importantly what we can actually provide we were able to gain a strong understanding of where to go from here.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Client communication, moving forward we need to have more consistent interaction with our client. We had issues during this sprint getting some information from them which made it hard for us to move forward with the sprint
   * GitHub streamlining, currently we are using the repository assigned to us, but we are still working on getting acquainted with projects and issues. Doing this will provide us with structure moving forward and will make it easier to complete sprints on time.
   * Product environment, currently we have no access to a working version of our project from the client which will make it hard going forward for us to develop this project. We need to create a reliable testing environment for our project which will allow for us to complete tasks in a timely manner.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Layout all issues for the sprint ahead of time instead of having to work backwards on them.
   * Create a better communication medium between us and the client so information can be transferred in a more reasonable amount of time.
   * Use commits for future documentation instead of using Google Docs so that auditors can better differentiate the contributions of team members.
