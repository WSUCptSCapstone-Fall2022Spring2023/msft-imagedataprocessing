# Sprint 3 Report (11/10/22 - 12/9/2022)

## What's New (User Facing)
* Nothing. No UI updates or integration started yet.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Together as a team over this last sprint we pulled together the loose parts from sprint 2 and put them together into a system. We were able to get all finalize all three major components within our embedded device to work together to create a alpha prototype. The hardest thing we ran into was dealing with duplicate id's within our database and Zach took it upon himself to fix that and create a more unique naming system. Remote configuration was the main thing we worked upon this sprint and it came together really well. The entire team was able to get involved and together we created a system that works for our project.

## Unfinished Work

We were unable to create our camera initialization executable or start on our post processor because we ran out of time with busy scedules while the semester winded down. Both of the issues were flagged to be pushed back to the start of semester two. However for both of these tasks we have started the planning and will be able to utilize that for the start of semester two.
