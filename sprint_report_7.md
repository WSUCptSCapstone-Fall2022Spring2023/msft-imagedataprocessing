# Sprint 7 Report (4/1/23 - 5/2/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Completed REST API with NDVI Data endpoint

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we focused our entire attention upon testing which provided us with a lot of work because for each issue we found we were forced to fix it and try again. We split the workup mainly with the intention to be prepared for the poster-confrence. ABHI did a large portion of the teams poster work and finished out the REST API by creating a proper endpoint for NDVI info while Zach and Jordan worked on fixing bugs and preparing the sensor for the demo. One huge issue we had to overcome was that the night before the post-confrence our sensor broke. This meant that we had to locate another device and re-configure and setit up so that we could demostrate at the confrence our project. Luckily our codebase worked extremtly well and we ran into minimal issues which allowed for us to show a good project at the poister confrence.

## Unfinished Work
All planned work is completed for this sprint & project.
