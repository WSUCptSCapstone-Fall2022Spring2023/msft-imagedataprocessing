# Sprint 6 Report (3/1 - 4/1/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
Nothing

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we spent our time creating documentation and processes for testing our system. We were able to revamp all of our tests to match the updated requirements of our system. Outside of creating test steps, expected results and tables in our documentation we were able to get our sensor into a greenhouse and start testing our system in a production enviornment.

## Unfinished Work
We ran out of time to verify if our NDVI data endpoint works properly. This will be finished next sprint. We need to go through now and finish up the documentation and testing for our project. We did not have time to put a 100% complete sticker on our documentation.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Execution of plans to design tests
  * Client interaction
  * Team communication
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Sustained effort across sprint. We noticed that we saved most of the work for the end and were busy during most of the sprint
   * Planning at start of sprint. This sprint we didn't layout clear goals and it clearly made it harder for us to be productive
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Starting work at the very start of the sprint so that we do not fall behind
   * Document early. We need to make sure that everything we do is heavily documented from here on out.
   * Proactively meet and continue to interact with the clients.
