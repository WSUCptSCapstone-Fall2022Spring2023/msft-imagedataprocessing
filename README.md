# AGIcam

## Project summary

### Agriculture Camera for collection farm data.

AGICam allows for farmers to collect and track data/images about the condition of their farm by installing AGIcam instances across their plots. Their information is collected efficiently and ensures that data is accurate.

### Additional information about the project

Originating from Pullman WA, Washington State University Phenomics Lab developed an Auridino-based IOT camera system known as AGIcam. This camera is tasked with monitoring crop conditions in remote fields. AgroDevs is a team of 3 WSU computer science students tasked with evaluating and improving data transfer and compression as well as evaluating edge computing and minimal power consumption solutions. Improving these aspects will allow for AGIcam to provide a better user experience and reduce overhead for farms using the sensor. Our team is working directly with Dr. Sankaran to meet these goals and advance the prosperity of  AGIcam. At the current stage of this project we are difrectly moving towards minimal power consmpution by rewriting our python implementation to C++ while providing extensive configurability  allowing for our product to be easier to use and draw less power giving it a longer lifespan.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
